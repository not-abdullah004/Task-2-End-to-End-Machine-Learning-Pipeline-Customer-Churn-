# Task-2-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline-Customer-Churn-

📌 Overview

This task implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using a telecom dataset. The pipeline covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model persistence.

📂 Files

task2_End-to-EndMLPipeline.ipynb – Main notebook containing the full ML pipeline

telco_churn.csv – Dataset used for training and evaluation

churn_pipeline_model.pkl – Trained and serialized ML model

🧠 Objective

To build a complete ML workflow that:

Processes raw customer data

Trains a churn prediction model

Evaluates performance

Saves the trained model for future inference

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Pickle

▶️ How to Run

Open task2_End-to-EndMLPipeline.ipynb

Ensure telco_churn.csv is in the same directory

Run all cells sequentially

The trained model will be saved as churn_pipeline_model.pkl

📊 Output

Model performance metrics (accuracy, etc.)

Saved ML model ready for deployment or reuse
